Import Ads+Users from CSV file in ClassiPress Theme

== Description ==

Need to import Ads+Users via CSV in a very SIMPLE way?

Then, it is the right plugin for you. What plugin does? It creates users, ads, categories via CSV file. 
If user or ad category doesnt exist it will create it!

* Import & Create Users
* Import & Create Users Ads
* Import & Create Categories

How it works?

** In a VERY VERY VERY simple way. Plugin will generate HEADER (first line in your CSV file) based on custom fileds (ad fileds). 
** You should populate those fileds with appropriate text and that's it! 
** You will be able to import ads from existing users if you put existing wp "user_email" in that field. In other case, plugin will register new user for you. 
** Plugin will add new categories if it does not find in existing list.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip “classipress-ads-importer.zip”. It will create ”classipress-ads-importer” folder.
2. Upload the “classipress-ads-importer” folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to import NEW users =

You should add “user_email” header into csv. That column can have already registered or new user’s email. If email isn’t registered, Import plugin will try to create it.

= Could I import new ad categories? =

Yes. You  can add new categories in column “ad_cat”.

= What is the password for newly created users? =

Password is randomly generated and not visible by the Importer Plugin (would be in the next version)
