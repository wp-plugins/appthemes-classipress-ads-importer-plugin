Import Ads+Users from CSV file in ClassiPress Theme

== Description ==

Need to import Ads+Users via CSV in a VERY SIMPLE way?

This is the right plugin for you. What plugin does? It creates or update users, user's ads, categories in ONE STEP via CSV file. If user or ad_category doesn't exist it will create it!

* Import & Create Users
* Import & Create User's Ads
* Import & Create Ad Categories

How it works?

* In a VERY VERY VERY simple way. Plugin will generate HEADER (first line in your CSV file) based on your custom fields (ad fields).
* You should populate those fields with appropriate text and that is it!
* You will be able to import ads from existing users if you put existing WP "user_email" in that field. In other case, plugin will register new user with that email address.
* Plugin will add new category if it does not find an existing one.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip ‚"classipress-ads-importer.zip". It will create "classipress-ads-importer" folder.
2. Upload the ‚"classipress-ads-importer" folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the ‚"Plugins" menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to import NEW users =

You should add ‚"user_email" header into csv. That column can have already registered or new user"s email. If email is not registered, Importer plugin will try to create it.

= Could I import new ad categories? =

Yes. You  can add new categories in column ‚"ad_cat".

= What is the password for newly created users? =

Password is randomly generated and not visible by the Importer Plugin (would be in the next version)
